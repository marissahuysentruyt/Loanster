# Loanster
Loan calculator project

Based on design files, I created a loan calculator. The user inputs 3 things: the duration/period, their preferred interest rate, and the principal amount for the loan. Loanster will calculate monthly payments from that information. Additionally, if a user knows how much they want to pay each month, plus their interest rate and principal, Loanster can figure out how long it would take the user to pay off the loan :)
